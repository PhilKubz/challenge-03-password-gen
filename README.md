## Description
The project goals are to randomly generate a password for the user using parameters that the user may define.

*JavaScript Functions* allow for users to have a seemless experience on the front-end, meanwhile the back-end of the page is sending windows and storing the answers the user gives in order to produce a password.

*Using info from the DOM* allows us to select elements in the HTML file and give some action/additional information to them all while being writtein in the JavaSCript file.

The Challenge 03 project includes notes in the JavaScript file, as well as alterations only being taken placei n the JavaScript file as a means of practice of functionality.


## Implementation
**JavaScript Functions:**
  - JavaScript functions allow for information on the page to be used and run through a set method that we write using variables that we set.
  - In this case, we use functions to allow us to use information stored in variables to generate a password.
    

**Prompt/Confirm**
  - Prompt/Confirm windows allow user functionality on the page. Prompt windows allow a user to input text into a field. Confirm windows allow us to ask a question and give the user an "okay" or "cancel" option. We may store the response of both as a variable for later usage.


**Using info from the DOM**
  - Using the DOM we are able to give functionality/information to specified elements in the HTML document all while being inside the JavaScript document.
  - In this case, we are using the elements "#password" and "#generate" to allow for cuntionality of these elements. For example, the "#generate" allows us to give functionlity to the button that is created in the HTML document.
